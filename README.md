**Steps to run Backend**
```
4) open another cmd/terminal
```
```
5) set current directory to backend
```
```
6) create and activate virtual environment
```
```
7) install all required libraries from requirements.txt using "pip install -r requirements.txt"
```

## Project statement
**Effective integration of Generative AI into programming learning environments**

The primary way in which learners engage with content in the IITM BS degree program is through the SEEK portal. The portal contains learning videos, assignments, resources, practice and graded assignments, and programming quizzes. The portal can be described as a learning environment and provides opportunities for self-learning, by enabling learners to learn at their own pace and schedule.

With the rapid advancement of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, there are promising possibilities of effective integration of GenAI into these learning environments. The goal of this term's software engineering project is to examine ways in which GenAI can be effectively integrated into learning environments such as SEEK. There are various ways in which possible integrations can be done.

**Here are some examples -**

1. Providing effective feedback in programming tests - In programming tests, after the results are announced, the feedback usually just mentions the test cases which passed/failed. Can GenAI be used to provide additional effective feedback for the code you have written?
2. Providing support while solving programming problems - Can GenAI support learners while they are solving practice programming problems?
3. Better engagement with content - Can GenAI add interactivity to otherwise static content such as pdfs, documents, and videos?

The above examples are just to give you an idea about the features which are possible. You are free to use/not use the above examples and come up with other innovative ideas.

Creating the full-fledged clone of SEEK is not possible given the time we have. Hence, you can constrain the development by creating a clone of the GenAI enhanced portal with just one course. For that course, you can pre-populate it with learning material, assignments, quizzes etc.

You are encouraged to use existing libraries, templates, APIs etc for various components in the system. For example, you can use [ACE](https://ace.c9.io/) as the code editor for your portal. You can use an online compiler API for compiling your code. You can use free and open source LLM model APIs such as Ollama to integrate GenAI capabilities into your system.
